    <p>
        We know that humans are complicated. There's no quick fix to brokenness, 
        especially because often we don't know what makes us broken in the first place.
        It's hard to give a name to those emotions that bubble up and disappear and boil over, 
        and that makes it impossible to know what we need to fix them.
    </p>

    <p>
        So let's go ahead and figure you out. With a tried and tested formula, we'll give a name to
        your emotions. If it has a name, then it's real, and you can come back here and pick 
        something to kick those emotions in the ass! Godspeed, my friend.
